###Â Branches:

1.  master branch - beginning, no webpack is set.
    Only react and react-dom packages are installed
2.  setup the webpack

        - npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
        - add new file: webpack.config.js
        - in config.json add new script:
          "build": "webpack --mode production"
        - in webpack.config.js, we shall import/export the modules using the commonJS/es5 syntax, because the webpack doesn't know yet the ex6, that is provided by babel.

        module.exports = {
        module: { // there are multiple modules that can be run within webpack
        rules: [ // rules - first module
        {}
        ]
        }
        }

        - install babel packages:
          npm i @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader --save-dev
        - webpack.config.js;
          module.exports = {
          module: {
          rules: [
          {
          test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
          },
          },
          ],
          },
          };
          "babel-loader" - is the module that will look for a file .babelrc
          .babelrc - file that tells babel library what does it need to transpile down to .

        - .babelrc :
            {
            "presets": ["@babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-react"]
            }
